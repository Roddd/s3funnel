# s3funnel

This project is a clone of <https://github.com/shazow>'s s3funnel from google code: <http://code.google.com/p/s3funnel/>. s3funnel is a multithreaded command line tool for Amazon's Simple Storage Service (S3).

- Written in Python, easy\_install the package to install as an egg.
- Supports multithreaded operations for large volumes. Put, get, or delete many items concurrently, using a fixed-size pool of threads.
- Built on workerpool for multithreading and boto for access to the Amazon S3 API.
- Unix-friendly input and output. Pipe things in, out, and all around.

Then I added Ceph and Swift as alternate storage backends. Provider is required. If a provider
is not defined, it defaults to AWS.

```
New options:
  --provider  Select storage provider (AWS, Swift, Ceph) [default: AWS]
  --host      [Optional] Alternate host
  --port      [Optional] Alternate port
```

## Usage
    $ s3funnel --help

    $ s3funnle mybukkit create --region ap-northeast-1
### List existing buckets
    $ s3funnel list
    mybukkit
### Put files in a bucket
    $ touch 1 2 3
    $ s3funnel mybukkit put 1 2 3
### List files in a bucket
    $ s3funnel mybukkit list
    1
    2
    3
### Copy files from a bucket
    $ rm 1 2 3
    $ s3funnel mybukkit get 1 2 3 --threads=2
    $ ls -1
    1
    2
    3
### Copy files from another bucket
